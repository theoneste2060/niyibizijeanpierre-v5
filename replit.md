A Node.js HTTP server with SQLite is employed for dynamic features such as view counts, contact form submissions, and newsletter subscriptions. The design adheres to a modern minimalist aesthetic with zero border-radius on all elements, a professional gradient theme (Engineering Blue: `#2E86C1`), and Montserrat/Open Sans typography. Key features include full responsiveness with a mobile-first approach, smooth scroll-triggered fade-in animations, enhanced hover effects, real-time search functionality on blog/projects/publications pages, dynamic social media icons, and clean URLs for improved user experience and SEO. Accessibility (WCAG compliant) and comprehensive SEO optimization (meta tags, Open Graph, JSON-LD, sitemap, robots.txt, canonical URLs) are integrated throughout.
